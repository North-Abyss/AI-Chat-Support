# AI-Driven Customer Support with Multi-Agents

Welcome to the official repository for our hackathon project: **AI-Driven Customer Support with Multi-Agents**. This project is part of the **Hack the Future: A Gen AI Sprint Powered by Data**, where we leverage AI-powered multi-agent systems to enhance customer service experiences.

## 🚀 Project Overview
It start from the src - Source folder 
Our goal is to build an AI-driven customer support system using multiple agents that can:
- Handle customer queries efficiently
- Provide real-time responses using generative AI
- Escalate complex issues to human support
- Learn from interactions to improve future responses

## 📌 Objectives
- Implement a multi-agent framework for customer support
- Utilize **Ollama-based on-prem LLMs** for response generation
- Integrate **custom tools** such as an API, web scraper, and ML models
- Store and retrieve customer interaction data using **SQLite DB**
- Develop an **embedding model** for better response matching

## 🏗️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: LangChain, FastAPI, OpenAI API
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Multi-Agent System**: Custom-built using Python frameworks
- **Deployment**: Docker
